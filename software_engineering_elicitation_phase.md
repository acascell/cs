**ABSTRACT**

In this paper I'll focus also on the strengths and weaknesses of developers during the requirements elicitation activity.

**DISCUSSION**

In the requirement phase the engineer starts collecting the official feedback from the customers about the product 
requirement, filling out a document named “customer statement of requirement”. In the following process the customer 
defines the main logic the products needs to assume in order to satisfy the primary demand, meets with the interested
parties producing a draft where are stated the main functionalities and the formulation of a “well defined problem”
including a description of the whole resources accounted for the development and a criteria definition including the 
objectives concerning the solution to the problem and the possible failures that might be occurring on the path to
the product delivery (Marsic I, 2015).
Continuing to deep-dive into the “requirements elicitation” phase there is an analysis performed to furtherly 
understand the specifics of the business context and the practical details about the system which will have to 
serve on daily bases the customer requirements. The following phase is absolutely crucial as well as very complex 
and hard to complete in the most precise way, as it is going to influence the following phases as well as the 
development itself (Marsic I, 2015).
 Here below, after this short introduction about the topic, I am going to describe, like requested from this week’s 
discussion assignments, the strengths and the weaknesses of the users and developers during the requirements 
elicitation activity.

On the user/stakeholder side different weakness points may occur:

- one of the main reoccurring issues concerning the user, is to not being able to properly define the main requirements the product should assume, as well as missing important details which would construct the actual skeleton of the product, causing very approximate modeling in the elicitation phase which would not actually correspond to the real prototype the development team would be in charge for.
- communication issues between the stakeholder and the actual development team/project manager, slowing the actual process and keeping on hold functionalities which would need to be rolled out but waiting to be confirmed from the user side, or on the other hand, functionalities which have not been requested but are being waited to been communicated to the developers which might be already planning a sprint including stories and splitting work-load, causing an overflow of work and missing resources to handle that particular objective
- overall complexity of the elicitation phase. Abstraction is a main key term in this phase and the complexity residing behind this concept might create difficulties in gathering the required details and form an abstract model. Stakeholders and users might not have grasped the right concepts to be able to completely understand and have a clear vision about the abstraction as a whole, in order to coordinate and collaborate with developers in filling the statement. (McConnell S, 1996).

As well as some strength points on user/stakeholder side:

- Closer collaboration with the development team, meaning to have an overall well maintained draft to work on about the 
project requirements
- Predefined list of requirements which can be prioritized in the next phases by the development team and scrum masters 
after the analysis of what gathered.
- A very detailed description of the requirements including specific details and abstract models which would help the 
team in the development process in the next phases.

On the development side the weakness points that could occur could be summarized in the following:

- when defining the statement, stakeholders and developers might have a different technical vision and terminology about 
the items to be filled on the paper concerning the final product, this might cause misunderstanding between users and 
developers, resulting in poor description of the domain problem which would lead the developers to leak in gathering 
specific important details slowing down the actual work when passing to the development phase.
- Developers tend to re utilize abstract models and patterns and fit them in a current project to be developed using the
law of not having to reinvent the wheel. This might be a disadvantage because could somehow lead the product to a 
different path than the original model described in the statement between the parties.
- Different figures are required in the requirement elicitation phase, sometimes a pure developer figure is not the 
proper character to fit this position, there might be personalities which better understand the customer/stakeholders 
needs and can translate those needs into a better abstraction rather than a pure developer (McConnell S, 1996).

Some strength point on the developer side could be the following:

- With the use of sketches and whiteboards, developers may have a better tool in order to contextualize some abstract
models at the eyes of the users/stakeholders, this is a great way to interact with parties which are not pretty 
technical but on the other hand being able to produce already an abstract model which is pretty neat since both parties 
can visualize directly a particular instance and determines the actions and the roles, which is a key item in the next 
phase when the development architecture needs to be produced, working for examples with objects and methods.
- The elicitation phase can help developers to get an important amount of details which would positively impact the next
phases, hence a strength point from the developer perspective in this phase is to be able to correctly collect in the proper manner those details and utilize them to create the right abstraction and models in the further steps (Laplante, P 2009).
